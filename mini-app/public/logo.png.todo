512x512
A stylized 2048 tile grid with four rows and four columns, each tile a square with a light gray background and a darker gray border. The center tile should be highlighted in a bright orange color with the number 2048 in large white font. The background should be a subtle gradient from dark blue at the top to light blue at the bottom, giving a modern, digital feel. The overall composition should be centered and balanced, with a slight drop shadow around the grid to give depth. No text other than the number 2048 on the highlighted tile.
